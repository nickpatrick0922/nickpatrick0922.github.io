Dogger, a game similar to the game frogger, involves a dog trying to cross the
street to get back to her dog house. The dog, Ziggy, is faced with a scenario involving
6 lanes of traffic with three sidewalks in between as well as patches of grass that
serve as safe zones. Simply put,the objective of the game is to get to the dog house
in the fewest moves possible without getting hit by the moving cars on the way.
If at any point Ziggy is hit with a car, the game starts over and the number of moves resets.


This game was inspired by my German Shepherd Ziggy. She may escape from time
to time but she always makes it back home :)
